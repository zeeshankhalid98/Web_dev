        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The first TBM was developed in 1825 by Marc Brunel, an English engineer, to excavate the Thames Tunnel in London. However, it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that modern TBMs were developed, featuring rotating cutting wheels and mechanized excavation.</p>

        <h2>Working</h2>
        <p>A TBM is a complex machine designed to excavate tunnels through various types of soil and rock. Here's a simplified overview of its working:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cutting Head:</strong> The cutting head is equipped with cutting tools, such as disc cutters or tungsten carbide teeth, which rotate to excavate the soil or rock.</li>
            <li><strong>Shield:</strong> The shield is a protective casing that surrounds the cutting head and supports the tunnel walls as excavation progresses.</li>
            <li><strong>Propulsion:</strong> The TBM is propelled forward by hydraulic or electric motors, which push the machine through the excavated soil or rock.</li>
            <li><strong>Muck Removal:</strong> The excavated material (muck) is removed from the tunnel through a conveyor belt or screw conveyor.</li>
            <li><strong>Segmental Lining:</strong> As the TBM advances, precast concrete segments are installed to form the tunnel lining, providing structural support and protection from groundwater.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of TBMs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hard rock TBMs</li>
            <li>Soft ground TBMs (e.g., earth pressure balance, EPB)</li>
            <li>Mixed ground TBMs</li>
            <li>Micro-TBMs (smaller machines for smaller tunnels)</li>
        </ul>
