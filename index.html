        <h2>About the Hydro Group</h2>
        <img src="image1.jpg" alt="About the Hydro Group" class="section-img">
        <p>The Water Resources and Hydrogeology Program falls under the umbrella of the Department of Earth System Science (ESS) within the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability at Stanford University. Our research interests span a range of topics including the scientific basis for water resources management with special interest in developing regions, ecohydrology, global freshwater vulnerability, surface-groundwater interactions, groundwater allocation policy, fluid flow and solute transport processes, innovative simulation techniques, and cutting-edge technologies in hydro geophysics and remote sensing for near-surface hydrology.</p>

        <h2>Graduate Program</h2>
        <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Graduate Program" class="section-img">
        <p>The PhD track (MS is not required to apply directly to the PhD program) combines earth sciences and engineering. Research integrates field data with quantitative modeling. The Stanford Hydro Group consists of graduate students and post-doctoral research associates working with Professor Steven Gorelick. We interact with faculty in other Stanford departments and many scientists around the world. The Hydro Group has taken the lead in developing the Global Freshwater Initiative through the Woods Institute for the Environment.</p>

The project will develop a long-term systems perspective and tools to identify viable paths to sustainability. It brings together scientists, engineers, economists, and stakeholder engagement experts from Stanford University in California, USA, IIASA (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis) in Laxenburg, Austria, ZEF (Hohenheim Centre for Development Research) in Leipzig, Germany, and IIASA (Australian Foundation for Development Research) in Vienna, Austria. The project is a not-for-profit research effort and part of the Sustainable Urbanisation Global Initiative of JPI Urban Europe and the Belmont Forum.

The overarching challenge is to sustain the human-natural system in the presence of rapid environmental and socioeconomic change. This interdisciplinary effort is aimed at developing a new approach to evaluate policies to enhance sustainability of freshwater resource systems. Our research is focused on Jordan, which is one of the ten water poorest countries in the world.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">A TBM is a complex machine designed to excavate tunnels through various types of soil and rock. Here's a simplified overview of its working:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Cutting Head:</strong> The cutting head is equipped with cutting tools, such as disc cutters or tungsten carbide teeth, which rotate to excavate the soil or rock.</li>
                            <li><strong>Shield:</strong> The shield is a protective casing that surrounds the cutting head and supports the tunnel walls as excavation progresses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Propulsion:</strong> The TBM is propelled forward by hydraulic or electric motors, which push the machine through the excavated soil or rock.</li>
                            <li><strong>Muck Removal:</strong> The excavated material (muck) is removed from the tunnel through a conveyor belt or screw conveyor.</li>
                            <li><strong>Segmental Lining:</strong> As the TBM advances, precast concrete segments are installed to form the tunnel lining, providing structural support and protection from groundwater.</li>
